# 👋🏾 Hey there, I'm Praise Echem

I'm a **UI/UX Designer** passionate about creating clean, functional, and human-centered digital experiences. With a strong foundation in product design, I'm currently **transitioning into frontend development** to better bridge the gap between design and implementation.

## 💼 My Skills

- 🎨 UI/UX Design (Web & Mobile)
- 🔄 Prototyping & Wireframing (Figma, Adobe XD)
- 🧠 Design Systems & Consistency
- 🧪 Usability Testing & Iterative Design
- 💬 Community & Social Media Management
- ⚙️ Product Strategy & Documentation
- 💻 Frontend Development (learning React & TailwindCSS)

## 🧩 My Experience

- Designed and improved interfaces for **startups**, **social impact tools**, and **internal enterprise products**.
- Worked on contract and in-house projects spanning **e-contract platforms**, **home service marketplaces**, and **booking systems**.
- Collaborated closely with developers and stakeholders to deliver accessible and scalable products.

## 🧠 Currently Learning

- JavaScript / React
- Git & GitHub workflows
- Frontend architecture
- Open-source collaboration

## 🔭 Why I'm Here

I want to **build in the open**, contribute to meaningful projects (especially around Web3, healthcare, or productivity), and grow as a **designer-developer hybrid**. If you're building something bold or experimental, I’d love to hear about it.
